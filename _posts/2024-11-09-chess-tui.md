# chess-tui |  A chess TUI implementation in rust ðŸ¦€  
## Open-source project

I participated in a hackathon [RustWorkshop](https://github.com/UPB-RustWorkshop), organized by [Politehnica University of Bucharest](https://upb.ro/) and I contributed to the open-source project [chess-tui](https://github.com/thomas-mauran/chess-tui).

### Project Description and my contributions
This project involves setting up a chess game in the terminal using the Rust programming language. The game is played against a player or a Stockfish bot. The game is implemented using the `ratatuile` library.

I have contributed to this project by adding the following features and I am currently working on adding more features to the project:
- [x] Added material difference evaluation [[https://github.com/thomas-mauran/chess-tui/pull/86]](https://github.com/thomas-mauran/chess-tui/pull/86)
- [x] Added a feature to go back to the main menu 
- [ ] Create new demo videos for the readme
- [ ] PGN file import
- [ ] PGN file export
